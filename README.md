# Book Recommendation System

A backend application designed to help users discover new books, read reviews, and get personalized recommendations based on their interests. Built with **NestJS**, **MongoDB**, and the **Google Books API**, it supports user authentication, book search, user reviews, and a basic recommendation engine.

## Features

- **Book Search**: Users can search for books by title, author, or keyword. Results come from the Google Books API.
- **Book Details**: View detailed information about each book, including title, authors, description, categories, and ratings.
- **User Authentication**: Users can create accounts, log in, and securely manage their sessions using JWT-based auth.
- **Reviews & Ratings**: Authenticated users can post reviews and ratings for books, and view reviews posted by other readers.
- **Recommendations**: A simple recommendation engine suggests books based on the userâ€™s review history and preferred categories.
